# php70-instantclient-composer

#todo: actually document this well
# Usage:
# docker build -t project-name-composer ./docker/phpcli/
# docker run -v $(pwd):/app -ti --rm project-name-composer install
# Note: project-name is arbitrary however with this naming I think it will be more natural to remember the container
# name.
